Pong game for OpenComputers Minecraft mod from: https://pastebin.com/gGHCE9MK
This is the orignal version for a Pong game in Lua made for Opencomputers minecraft mod.
Its made by a user from https://pastebin.com/gGHCE9MK so all credits go to him or her.

Its a working 2-player pong game (it has no AI yet)

When you load the game press any key once and your name will show up as player 1, then get your friend to do so as well so he will be player 2, then press enter to start (you can play with yourself but this was left for testing purposes)

First one to score 10 times wins

Press space at any point of the game to exit

he designed this to work with tier 1 computers with openOS, didnt test it on other tiers
See:https://oc.cil.li/index.php?/topic/849-pong-because-why-not/


Once again i did not make this game I only am making it open through github because I am planning on improving it and making it possible for the other tier computers to work as well.
Inluding different screen sizes.
